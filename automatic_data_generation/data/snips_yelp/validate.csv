"Love Marche and have since I went as a kid to their location in Singapore!
The problem with Marche is that you walk in and are overwhelmed by the options and the abundance of choice. No worries though because I've written you a handy list of pro tips to enjoy Marche; 

1) Avoid office lunch rush hours. If you want to go from 12 - 1:30 then you're committing to a very chaotic experience

2) If you're in an indecisive mood just skip marche for that day (i.e. it took you more than 2 minutes to pick out your outfit in the morning)

3) Try their rosti - it's a classic!

My personal favourite is their green curry but just explore and enjoy!!!",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ,"Love Marche and have since I went as a kid to their location in Singapore!

The salads are delicious and the portion sizing is huge! Good thing it's a salad so there is no harm in actually finishing what you get! I've had the Tokyo and the Mexican - both were really incredible.

"The standard for decor and atmosphere for Montreal dumpling places is unfortunately low. HarBin shines out as a beacon within a land of despair with its stylish and cool interior.

"Was excited to try this spot out as soon as it opened after seeing the menu for their different locations. 

The service was fantastic! Everyone was friendly and we had two people check in with us after we got our food. The waitress was patient and explained the menu to us and answered our questions which. The only thing we didn't enjoy was the noise level at the restaurant. It was hard to hold conversation and we were periodically startled by the random Japanese shouts which as classic to ramen joints. 

LOVED that they had two vegetarian options which were very distinct from each other. There was a creamy vegan broth with a thick noodle which was very rich and paired well with the silken tofu topping and thick and chewy ramen noodle. The second option was a vegetarian broth that was lighter and much more savoury topped with a tonne of vegetables and a lighter noodle.

The service was fantastic! Everyone was friendly and we had two people check in with us after we got our food. The waitress was patient and explained the menu to us and answered our questions which. The only thing we didn't enjoy was the noise level at the restaurant. It was hard to hold conversation and we were periodically startled by the random Japanese shouts which as classic to ramen joints. 

LOVED that they had two vegetarian options which were very distinct from each other. There was a creamy vegan broth with a thick noodle which was very rich and paired well with the silken tofu topping and thick and chewy ramen noodle. The second option was a vegetarian broth that was lighter and much more savoury topped with a tonne of vegetables and a lighter noodle. Both were spectacular though the creamy vegan broth was definitely more filling.

"Stepping into Sel Gras in the middle of a cold windy montreal evening, you feel the low warm lighting wash over you as you slowly start to thaw. The waiter was quick to seat us at a lovely booth (thankfully it was a slow Monday night or I doubt the 2 booths are free often!) where we sunk into the welcoming leather. The ambience was really created by their fantastic music! 

The risotto was creamy and the arugula added and unexpected freshness to the dish. The serving size was really generous - perhaps since i ordered it without the duck confit. Glad they have a veggie item on the menu! The chicken was perfectly cooked and moist and tender according to my dining partner. Their plating is really appealing.

"I've been going to guru lukshmi since they had their stall in the Newin centre way back when (I wasn't even in High School yet!). 

The food has always been consistently fantastic. Their sambhar is always rich and flavourful, the chutnies perfect and the dosas just divine.

"If you're an Indian food fan and are looking to try something new then you should definitely check out Thanjai!

"If you want to visit Heaven I've found the address and it's 546 Avenue Duluth. 

Walking into the shop you're immediately enveloped by a warm sweet aroma that makes you wish your house always smelt like this. You're unsure where to look because there are too many delicious treats to stare at!

I had the wonderful pleasure of being assisted by the shop's namesake Chloe herself. She gave me a fresh cardamom chocolate which was absolutely brilliant. I picked up a sponge toffee and from Chloe's recommendation her masala chocolate bar. 

The sponge toffee is absolute perfection! Crispy and not too sweet, coated in a thing layer of chocolate. Now with the masala chocolate bar I was slightly suspicious....it just didn't make sense to me. All my worries were washed away after one bite of this chocolate bar. It was smooth and silky with light hints of different spices that were married into the milky sweet chocolate. 

Beyond the delicious treats, the experience in the store is very pleasant. Chloe is such a delight and it's very nice to see the pride she runs her shop with. All of the staff is warm and genuinely just happy (this is why it's Heaven!)

"I had heard the most wonderful things about Qing Hua, online and offline but my visit left me incredibly disappointed. 

We entered into the restaurant and were seated right by the door which was unpleasant because of the cold winter draft we were hit with every few minutes. We looked around and there was a table at the back that we took the liberty of moving to; alas we weren't seated there initially!

I started off with a hot & sour soup which tasted okay but was the strangest shade of light grey; not the usual colour one expects! We all ordered fried dumplings - I ordered the tofu vegetable kind. It took absolute ages for our food to arrive which was really unexpected. Alas, it was not worth the wait. The filling of my dumplings were too salty and the skins were dry. My friend's dumplings were served in a plate that was pooling with water; which filled their dumplings making them soggy. 

It was all so inconsistent with mediocre service, a long wait and food that was sloppy. Perhaps we went at a bad time but I was left with a bad impression that doesn't entice me to return.

"Went to this a few months ago and am just now getting around to reviewing it.  A fun and entertaining trip through Vegas musical history with a very talented cast of singers, dancers, and musicians!  Definitely worth seeing.  Whether you're a local, or a tourist just passing through, you'll have fun with this show.

"Went here last night with some friends for a Cocktail City event.  I have no idea how much it usually costs to get in here, but we got in free - of which I'm glad.  I accidentally left my water bottle in my purse, and luckily they didn't take it, but I still had to dump it out.  I understand no outside liquids, but when I went to the bar to ask for water, they said (alcoholic) drinks were free, but they only had bottled water, and you had to pay for it.  Only in a Las Vegas nightclub would they charge for water when it's 100 degrees outside.  Alcohol dehydrates you.  The least they could do is give me a cup of water from the tap with my alcohol, especially if I'm staying there a while.

I guess I'm not a fan of nightclubs, anyway, because I value my hearing, but it was very crowded, and I hate it when people don't move when you ask.  I definitely physically pushed people out of my way, and got pushed by other people.  I went to the balcony to try and spot my friends on the dance floor below, and the people standing there literally pushed me back so they could stand there and talk and not let me even see.  Welcome to Las Vegas.

As I was going in and out of the club, there are so many different lines, and you literally feel like you're being herded like cattle.  The staff is not paid to be friendly, I suppose, but only one of the staff members I interacted with had any notable personality (actually it was the guy who asked me to dump out my water, and he was friendly and funny about it, which is why I obliged so easily).  And yes, I'm also confused as to why the dance floor is roped off.  It was so crowded that I could hardly move.

The sound guys kept up with us, and we threw them a couple of curve balls.  There's a nice dance floor, for those who want to take advantage of it, and the place has a nice, open feel to it.

"I had the spinach enchilada, and it was delicious!  The service my friends and I received here was also great.  The server was very friendly and attentive.  If I lived in Phoenix, I'd likely be back here.  (Only small complaint: wish they had more for vegetarians!)",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ,"I had the spinach enchilada, and it was delicious!

"What a terrific experience!  We had a fantastic Teppanyaki chef who was both entertaining and dazzled me with his ""tricks"" as he cooked our table's food - which tasted amazing, by the way!  Both my date and I thought our respective dishes were very delicious.  Also, he cooked my tofu before he cooked the meat - this probably wouldn't mean much to a meat eater, but means a lot to me, since I've been a lifelong vegetarian for health and ethical reasons.  I can't lie, I was a little worried about it, since everyone else ordered meat dishes - but I was not disappointed; huge points with me!  This is a restaurant I bookmark as a place to come back and enjoy again!",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ,"What a terrific experience!
